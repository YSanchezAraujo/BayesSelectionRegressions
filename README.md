# Bayesian Selection regressions via type 2 maximum likelihood / empirical bayes / evidence optimization
Orginally simple implementations of automatic relevance determination for linear and logistic regression, but now also has ridge regression available. Details are given at:

These methods are suitable when you have relatively large amounts of data, that you can confidently estimate the hyperparameters via evidence optimizaton.
